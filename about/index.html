                <h2>Welcome to My World</h2>
                <p>My name is Z, and my pronouns are they/them. I'm a 20-year-old tech enthusiast with a passion for all things creative and innovative.</p>
                <p>I hold an Associate of Arts and an Associate of Science in Cyber and Information Security from Lorain County Community College (LCCC). I've been using Linux for around four years and working professionally in IT for about two years.</p>

                <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
                <p>When I'm not working or experimenting with technology, I enjoy a variety of hobbies that help me stay balanced and creative. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Creative Writing</strong>: Collaborating on short stories with my partner S, exploring genres from science fiction to fantasy.</li>
                    <li><strong>3D Printing</strong>: Bringing ideas to life by creating both practical items and fun models.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gardening</strong>: Spending time outdoors and nurturing plants, which offers a refreshing break from the digital world.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gaming</strong>: Exploring new worlds and solving challenges through video games.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
                <p>My journey into IT started at a young age, driven by a fascination with how things work behind the scenes. I decided to formalize my passion through studies in Cyber and Information Security at LCCC. Since then, I've been fortunate enough to work professionally in IT, gaining hands-on experience with a range of technologies and systems.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am expanding my skill set by diving deeper into cybersecurity, Linux administration, and cloud solutions. I believe in lifelong learning, and I'm excited to continue growing in this ever-evolving industry.</p>

                <h2>Why This Website?</h2>
                <p>This website is a place for me to document my journey, share my thoughts, and connect with others who share similar passions. Whether it's a new blog post on technology, a project I've been working on, or a collaborative short story with my partner, I hope to create a space that is both informative and inspiring for anyone visiting.</p>
