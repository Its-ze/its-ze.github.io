            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As my side IT business and full-time job both continue to expand, managing my workload efficiently has become crucial. I've tried different task management systems, and I recently started using <strong>Any.do</strong> to streamline everything I need to keep track of—from client maintenance tasks to my personal projects. Here’s how Any.do has helped me take control of my time.</p>
