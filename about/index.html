        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Z. My pronouns are they/them, and I'm currently 20 years old. I hold an Associate of Arts and an Associate of Science in Cyber and Information Security from Lorain County Community College (LCCC).</p>
        <p>I've been using Linux for around four years, and I've been working in the IT field professionally for about two years. Linux has been a significant part of my personal and professional life, and I enjoy learning new things about technology, security, and open-source software.</p>
        <p>My partner, S, is also part of this project and will be contributing short stories alongside me. Together, we aim to share our creative endeavors, whether it be blog posts, projects, or imaginative stories.</p>

        <h3>My Interests and Hobbies</h3>
        <p>When I'm not working or experimenting with technology, I enjoy a variety of hobbies that help me stay balanced and creative. Here are a few things that keep me busy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Creative Writing</strong>: Besides my work in tech, I love creative writing. My partner and I often collaborate on short stories that explore different genres, from science fiction to fantasy.</li>
            <li><strong>3D Printing</strong>: I enjoy tinkering with 3D printers, creating both practical items and fun models. Itâ€™s amazing to see ideas come to life in a tangible form.</li>
            <li><strong>Landscaping</strong>: My first job was in landscaping, and it still holds a special place in my heart. Whenever I can, I spend time in my garden or help friends and family with their outdoor projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaming</strong>: Video games are another way I like to relax. They allow me to explore new worlds, solve problems, and have fun between work sessions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My Professional Journey</h3>
        <p>My journey into IT started at a young age, driven by a fascination with how things work behind the scenes. I decided to formalize my passion through studies in Cyber and Information Security at LCCC. Since then, I've been fortunate enough to work professionally in IT, gaining hands-on experience with a range of technologies and systems.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am expanding my skill set by diving deeper into cybersecurity, Linux administration, and cloud solutions. I firmly believe in lifelong learning, and I'm excited to continue growing in this ever-evolving industry.</p>

        <h3>Why This Website?</h3>
        <p>This website is a place for me to document my journey, share my thoughts, and connect with others who share similar passions. Whether it's a new blog post on technology, a project I've been working on, or a collaborative short story with my partner, I hope to create a space that is both informative and inspiring for anyone visiting.</p>
